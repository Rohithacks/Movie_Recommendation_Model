# Movie_Recommendation_Model
This repository provides a Movie Recommendation System developed using Jupyter Notebook and Collaborative Filtering. The system recommends movies based on users' preferences and behaviors, applying collaborative filtering techniques that predict ratings for movies a user hasnâ€™t seen yet by leveraging patterns from similar users or items.
